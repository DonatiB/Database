Practice with:

- Extended Entity and Relationship Models.

- Relational database models (using vertabelo as a tool).

- SQL statements (Structured Query Language).
I create and modify (DDL) the
database schema, tables, constraints, views, etc. and I do
query and update data (DML)
(insertion, modification, deletion)
